            policy.<br /><br />If you don’t wish to accept cookies from us, you should instruct your browser to refuse

            data that a website stores on your device when you visit, typically containing information about the website
            itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognize your web browser when you return, additional
            data that serves the purpose of the cookie, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.<br /><br />Cookies are
            used to enable certain features (e.g. logging in), to track site usage (e.g. analytics), to store your user
            settings (e.g. time zone, notification preferences), and to personalize your content (e.g. advertising,
            language).<br /><br />Cookies set by the website you are visiting are normally referred to as “first-party
            cookies”, and typically only track your activity on that particular site. Cookies set by other sites and
            companies (ie. third parties) are called “third-party cookies”, and can be used to track you on other
            websites that use the same third-party service.<br /><br />Types of cookies and how we use
            them<br />Essential cookies<br /><br />Essential cookies are crucial to your experience of a website,
            enabling core features like user logins, account management, shopping carts and payment processing. We use
            essential cookies to enable certain functions on our website.<br /><br />Performance
            cookies<br /><br />Performance cookies are used in the tracking of how you use a website during your visit,
            without collecting personal information about you. Typically, this information is anonymous and aggregated

            identify and diagnose problems or errors their users may encounter, and make better strategic decisions in
            improving their audience’s overall website experience. These cookies may be set by the website you’re
            visiting (first-party) or by third-party services. We use performance cookies on our
            site.<br /><br />Functionality cookies<br /><br />Functionality cookies are used in collecting information
            about your device and any settings you may configure on the website you’re visiting (like language and time
            zone settings). With this information, websites can provide you with customized, enhanced or optimized
            content and services. These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by
            third-party service. We use functionality cookies for selected features on our
            site.<br /><br />Targeting/advertising cookies<br /><br />Targeting/advertising cookies are used in
            determining what promotional content is more relevant and appropriate to you and your interests. Websites
            may use them to deliver targeted advertising or to limit the number of times you see an advertisement. This
            helps companies improve the effectiveness of their campaigns and the quality of content presented to you.
            These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by third-party services.
            Targeting/advertising cookies set by third-parties may be used to track you on other websites that use the
            same third-party service. We use targeting/advertising cookies on our site.<br /><br />Third-party cookies
            on our site<br /><br />We may employ third-party companies and individuals on our websites—for example,
            analytics providers and content partners. We grant these third parties access to selected information to
            perform specific tasks on our behalf. They may also set third-party cookies in order to deliver the services
            they are providing. Third-party cookies can be used to track you on other websites that use the same
            third-party service. As we have no control over third-party cookies, they are not covered by Revolution
            Cannabis’s cookie policy.<br /><br />2. Our third-party privacy promisesWe review the privacy policies of

            websites from multiple devices, you may need to update your settings on each individual
            device.<br /><br />Although some cookies can be blocked with little impact on your experience of a website,
